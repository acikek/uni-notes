# uni-notes

In this repository, you will find my lecture notes for classes taken at [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/). Most of the content here will cover pure mathematics.

This repository is divided into quarters, then classes, then specific lecture dates. All documents are written in [the Typst language](https://typst.app/) and sit alongside PDF exports.

I plan to compile my notes into digital books; I will do this for each course at the end of the corresponding quarter. Before styling and compilation, I consider the documents *drafts*.
